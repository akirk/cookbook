## Description

Cookbook gives your WordPress site a private recipe app at `/cookbook/`. Recipes are stored as WordPress content, with structured ingredients, instructions, categories, cuisines, tags, photos, serving sizes, prep and cook times, source URLs, and notes.

It is built for day-to-day cooking rather than public recipe blogging: save recipes from the web, scale portions while you cook, convert between metric and imperial units, track what you have cooked, plan meals for the week, and build a shopping list from the recipes you choose.

### Recipe storage

Each recipe is stored as a `cb-recipes` custom post type with recipe taxonomies for category, cuisine, tag, and ingredient. Shopping lists, week plans, and cooking history are stored as user-authored WordPress content so they remain tied to the signed-in user.

### Import recipes from the web

Paste a recipe URL and Cookbook looks for schema.org `Recipe` data and HTML recipe metadata. It supports recipe sections, ingredient groups, instruction sections, and recipe images where the source page exposes them. If automatic parsing is not enough, paste recipe text and preview the detected title, ingredients, and instructions before saving.

Photos can be sideloaded into the WordPress media library and used as the recipe's featured image.

### Cook with scaled ingredients

Recipe pages include live portion scaling. Enter the number of servings you want and Cookbook rescales parsed ingredient amounts immediately. Unit display can be switched between metric and imperial globally in settings or per recipe while viewing it.

### Cooking mode and history

Cooking mode gives you a focused view with a large active step, step navigation, ingredient and instruction checkoffs, browser-saved progress, and screen wake lock where supported. When you finish, Cookbook can save that you cooked the recipe. You can also add dated "cooked this" entries from recipe pages.

### Meal planning and shopping

Use the week planner to place recipes into breakfast, lunch, and dinner slots. Add a recipe's scaled ingredients, or a full week's planned recipes, to your personal shopping list. The shopping list combines compatible duplicate items and includes a focused shop mode with large tap targets, undo, and quick add.

### Ingredients and variations

Cookbook can help you find recipes by ingredients you have on hand, allowing a configurable number of missing ingredients. Ingredient tools let you browse ingredient pages, replace an ingredient from a recipe view, and merge, group, or rename ingredient terms.

Recipe variations let you link adapted recipes to their originals. Use "Edit as variation" to create a prefilled child recipe from an existing one.

### Browser extension import

Cookbook integrates with the [Friends browser extension](https://github.com/akirk/browser-extension). After authorizing the extension for your site, use the "Save as Recipe" action on a recipe page and Cookbook will import the current page HTML.

### AI and automation

When the WordPress Abilities API is available, Cookbook registers abilities for recipe search, recipe reading, recipe creation, recipe import, variation creation, and week-plan reading and saving. This allows compatible AI assistants and automations to work with your saved recipes in a structured way.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Where do I manage recipes?

Visit `/cookbook/` on your site after activating the plugin. The app uses WordPress users and permissions, but it is separate from your active theme.

### Can I import recipes from any website?

Cookbook works best with pages that expose schema.org `Recipe` data or recognizable recipe markup. If a site cannot be parsed automatically, you can paste the recipe text and use the preview before saving.

### Does Cookbook publish my recipes publicly?

Cookbook is designed as a personal app. Recipes are stored in WordPress and viewed through the `/cookbook/` app by users with the required permissions.

### Can I switch between metric and imperial units?

Yes. Set your default in `/cookbook/settings`, or switch units while viewing a recipe.

### Can I make a shopping list from a weekly meal plan?

Yes. Add recipes to the week planner, then add the planned recipes' ingredients to your shopping list.

### Does Cookbook work with Static Archive?

Yes. If the Static Archive plugin is active, Cookbook can opt recipes into the archive and render structured recipe content as HTML and Markdown.

### Is Cookbook translatable?

Yes. The text domain is `cookbook`, and a German translation is included.
